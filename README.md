<h1>Webble</h1>

Open source project on web development components having the vision to turn it into a library. It will help developers build awesome looking websites in a easy and faster way. 

We will use already existing Bootstrap library and its existing classes for different components to make our own awesome looking components. We are not using jquery in our library, so javascript will be written from scratch for the components wherever it will be needed.

Components -

Initially we are focusing on only few major components which are listed below :

1. Navbar
2. Card
3. Button
4. Carousel
5. Dropdowns
6. Forms
7. Modal
